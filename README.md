# CellularAutomata
This is an experiment with cellular automata; Functional mod for Rem's Engine.

<!-- todo preview -->

I was inspired to experiment with them by [Tantan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63qlEpO73C4&ab_channel=Tantan).

## Building
This is a mod for Rem's Engine, so first build the engine. Then you can build this project, e.g. with Intellij Idea.
There are no dependencies besides my engine.
